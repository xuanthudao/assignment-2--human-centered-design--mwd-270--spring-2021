## Rules
* Only submit files that are required by your project. Modify `.gitignore` as needed.
* Use lowercase, combined with kebab case, to name _all_ folders and files (`do-this` or `do-this.html`); no spaces in folder or file names (`not this`); no camel case (`notThis`); no snake case (`not_this`).
* Place all comps in the `comps` folder.
* Place all markup in `index.html`. Add HTML files as necessary.
* Place all CSS in `style.css`.
* Place all JavaScript in `app.js`.
* Place all images in the `img` folder.
* Do not remove any of the `.gitignore` files.
